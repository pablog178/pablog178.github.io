This is based on a similar idea from other personal blogs I’ve been following and to expect I could come up with more ideas and, overall, I could pass through my constant fears about being judged and laughed at, Internet style (that is, maximum troll with  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">doxxing</a>  and all the whole package).\nAnyway, that was quite an introduction, let me get started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>🏖 Last Wednesday I was at the beach with my family, it was like 6 years since the last time I was at the beach or taking a day to <strong>actually</strong> relax and enjoy myself; it was like 10 years since the last time I gave me time to pass with my mom; and it was like the first time me and my girlfriend got to enjoy the day without worrying about <strong>anything</strong> else. I would definitely do it again, it was perfect.</li>\n<li>📚 On Thursday, I got a time to take some rest from the previous day lol. I started to read through the Book  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164\">Clean Architecture, by Robert C. Martin</a> , which I bought like 2 months ago but I was being too lazy to start reading. It’s actually pretty god and 6 days later I’m at 60% of it (according to the Kindle App), once I started I couldn’t stop and every time I get some free time, I continue reading it.</li>\n<li>🍽 On Friday, after 4 straight days doing 1 hour of jogging down the beach, we got visited by an old friend form college, there we got to take some of the best food you could get in ~<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz_(city)\">Veracruz, Mexico</a>~ (pic related).</li>\n<li>🌮 On Saturday, I got to get more time to visit my family, given that I was on my hometown, I managed to get a chance to visit them and greet in person, it was a nice experience, different from a regular Saturday for me. On the evening we got a romantic dinner with my girlfriend ( <a href=\"http://www.losgiros.com/\">tacos</a>  lol, best-dinner-ever) 😍🥰</li>\n<li>🛫 On Sunday, travel day, it was a back-to-reality day: Time to say goodbye to my family and say hello to the workload and check email, Slack and any other messages for the upcoming Monday. yay! 😢</li>\n<li>👨‍💻 Monday and Tuesday have been more about the same. Work, work, work. I’ve continued reading Clean Architecture and using my free time as best as I could: separating garbage in  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate\">PETE</a> , cardboard and Others; taking care of my dogs; reading through my Pocket list (I only have 128 articles left, from 350 I started with 2 months ago 🎉); greeting friends and family and spending some time learning Swift 5.</li>\n<li>✍️ Today I <del>remembered</del> decided it was a good time to come back to my blog, I created it to put whatever I wanted, but I have actually been almost inactive for a long period of time. So I’m starting these series now and hopefully I will catch up with some new topics in the coming weeks.\nThat’s pretty much it, I have been skipping my training this week, my knees hurt (not really, but I need to blame something else bu myself).</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Journal #1","date":"May 18, 2019","description":"(Not so) Weekly journal #1"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal-001/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/async-code/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aynchronous code (in JavaScript)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-2019/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2009 --> 2019"}}}}}
